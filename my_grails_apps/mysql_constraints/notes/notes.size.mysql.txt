It says "Uses a Groovy range to restrict the size of a collection, a number, or the length of a String."
But this does not seem to work with numbers.
For collections that are one-to-many, it allows a record to be saved with nothing in the collection. But if you specify at least one, the size of the collection must be within the range specified. I guess you would need nullable or minSize for that.

But when you try to edit a record, then it complains

<div class="fieldcontain  ">
	<label for="firstString">
		First String
		
	</label>
	<input type="text" name="firstString" maxlength="15" value="" id="firstString" />
</div>

<div class="fieldcontain  required">
	<label for="firstInt">
		First Int
		<span class="required-indicator">*</span>
	</label>
	<input type="number" name="firstInt" value="0" required="" id="firstInt" />
</div>

<div class="fieldcontain  ">
	<label for="maxClasses">
		Max Classes
		
	</label>
	<select name="maxClasses" multiple="multiple" size="5" class="many-to-many" id="maxClasses" >
</select>
</div>
