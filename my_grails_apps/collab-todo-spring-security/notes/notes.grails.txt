Trying again, since what I had did not work at all.

First created the app:
grails create-app spring-security-002

gvm use groovy 2.1.9
gvm use grails 2.3.0

Next I will create the dbs in postgres

sudo -u postgres psql postgres

create user collab_dev with password 'dev-word-to-pass001';
create database spring_security_002_dev_db with owner collab_dev;
grant all privileges on database spring_security_002_dev_db to collab_dev;

To log in: psql -h localhost -U collab_dev -d collab_todo_dev_db

create user collab_test with password 'test-word-to-pass001';
create database spring_security_002_test_db with owner collab_test;
grant all privileges on database spring_security_002_test_db to collab_test;


Next, update 
plugins {
   …
   compile ':spring-security-core:2.0-RC2'
}

Note that until the 2.0 version of the plugin is officially released, you'll also need to add a custom repository:

repositories {
   …
   mavenRepo 'http://repo.spring.io/milestone'
}

Run the compile script to resolve the dependencies and ensure everything is correct:

$ grails compile

To get it to actually work, add this to grails-app/conf/Config.groovy
grails.plugin.springsecurity.rejectIfNoRule = false
grails.plugin.springsecurity.fii.rejectPublicInvocations = false
