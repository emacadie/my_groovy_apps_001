grails shiro-ui-quick-start
no output

I had to rearrange some files, since both plugins made a role and user domain. But the UI plugin made nice controllers for role and user. It lists the permissions for all the actions in the controller pages. I guess it just makes a list of the actions.

grails create-domain-class info.shelfunit.misc.Book
grails generate-all info.shelfunit.misc.Book

I don't get the style when I log in. I have to look into that.
It looks okay in shiro004
There is a shiro-ui taglib: that is how it gets the permissions

In the controller:
In ShiroRoleController.save, with params: [description:, name:ROLE_BOOKER, permissions:[book:create, book:delete, book:edit, book:index, book:save, book:show, book:update], create:Create, action:save, format:null, controller:shiroRole]
