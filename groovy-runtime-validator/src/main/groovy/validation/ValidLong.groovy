/**
<p>This is an annotation to validate/constrain long fields in Plain Old Groovy Objects.</p>
<p>Here is an example on how to use it:</p>
<pre>
    @ValidLong( minValue = 0L, maxValue = 1000L, throwEx = false )
    long firstLong
    @ValidLong( minValue = 2147483648L )
    def secondLong
    @ValidLong( minValue = 10L, divisorSet = [ 3L, 5L ] )
    long dasFizzbuzz
</pre>
<p>If the field is defined as "long" and it is given a value in the first call to setX that is outside your constraints, then it will be set to 0. If the field is defined as "def" and it is given a value that is outside your constraints, then it will be set to null. If the field already has a valid value and it is sent an invalid one in a call to setX, the new, invalid value will be ignored.</p>

<p>An application, class or library that uses this annotation must also import {@link validation.ImmutableValidator} to use this in an immutable object.</p>

<p>You must append the "L" at the end of the number. If you set "throwException" to true for {@link validation.ImmutableValidator} and an exception is thrown, the "L" will not be printed as part of the number in the message.</p>

<p></p>
