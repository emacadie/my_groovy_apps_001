/**
<p>This is an annotation to validate/constrain integer fields in Plain Old Groovy Objects.</p>
<p>Here is an example on how to use it:</p>
<pre>
    @ValidInt( minValue = 30, maxValue = 400, throwEx = false )
    int firstInt
    @ValidInt( maxValue = 400 )
    def secondInt
    @ValidInt( minValue = 10, divisorSet = [ 3, 5 ] )
    int dasFizzbuzz
</pre>
<p>If the field is defined as "int" and it is given a value in the first call to setX that is outside your constraints, then it will be set to 0. If the field is defined as "def" and it is given a value that is outside your constraints, then it will be set to null. If the field already has a valid value and it is sent an invalid one in a call to setX, the new, invalid value will be ignored.</p>

<p>An application, class or library that uses this annotation must also import {@link validation.ImmutableValidator} to use this in an immutable object.</p>
<p></p>
