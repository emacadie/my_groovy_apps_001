This is a project intended to give you the opportunity to show off your design, problem solving and testing skills. Completeness and comprehensive testing are not the goal, we just want to see how you think and how you work. The problem is intended to take a couple of hours to complete.   
 
The problem:  

Write a number prettifier:   

Write tested code (in any language) that accepts a numeric type and returns a truncated, "prettified" string version. The prettified version should include one number after the decimal when the truncated number is not an integer. It should prettify numbers greater than 6 digits and support millions, billions and trillions.   

Examples:   

    input: 1000000    

    output: 1M    

 

    input: 2500000.34    

    output: 2.5M    

 

    input: 532    

    output: 532    

 

    input: 1123456789    

    output: 1.1B    


Please send us your code and any supporting information once you are done.  Include a brief overview describing your approach, assumptions, design decisions, requirements questions, or anything you think needs clarification.  Be prepared to discuss in more detail and iterate on the problem.
